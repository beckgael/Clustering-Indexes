# Clustering Indexes

Here are a bit of work i've made during my Ph.D thesis, it concern clustering evaluation. It will gather some internal clustering index as [Davies Bouldin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index) and [Silhouette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) and external one as the (normalized) [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information). There will be implemented neither in pure scala neither in scala/spark.

## For the moment
